Contributing
============

Help is greatly appreciated, just please remember to clone the **development**
branch and to run `tox` before creating pull requests.

Travis tests for `flake8` support and test coverage so it's always good to
check those before creating a pull request.

Development branch:
https://github.com/WoLpH/django-schema-generator/tree/development

A simple trick to speed up your tox runs is to use detox, it runs all tox
processes in parallel.

```
pip install tox detox
detox
```
